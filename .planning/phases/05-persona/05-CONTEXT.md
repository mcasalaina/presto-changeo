# Phase 5: Persona - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When the user switches to an industry mode, a persona is generated that serves two purposes: a visible customer profile card and consistent background data the AI references naturally.

The persona feels like a real customer you're demoing with. There's a compact header card showing who you're "working with" — their name, maybe an avatar placeholder, a key stat or two. But more importantly, the AI knows this persona's details and weaves them into conversation organically. Ask about account balance? The AI knows it. Ask about recent claims? Consistent answers every time.

The persona persists within a session. Same person, same data, no contradictions. Switch modes, get a new persona appropriate to that industry.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Consistency** — Same persona data every time within a session. No contradictions when asking the same question twice.
- **Industry authenticity** — Data feels right for the mode. Banking personas have account balances and transactions. Insurance has claims and policies. Healthcare has medical history.
- **Natural AI integration** — The AI references persona details organically, not robotically. It should feel like the AI actually knows this customer.

## Specific Ideas

- Compact header card at top of dashboard — minimal and clean, doesn't compete for attention
- Name, one key metric, subtle presence
- Seeded generation so same mode = same persona within session
- AI system prompt includes persona details so responses are contextually aware

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

The persona is about establishing believability. It's what makes the demo feel like a real industry tool rather than a generic chatbot. The header card is the "face" but the real value is the AI being able to speak knowledgeably about this specific customer's situation.
