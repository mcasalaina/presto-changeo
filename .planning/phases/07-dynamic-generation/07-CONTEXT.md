# Phase 7: Dynamic Generation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Magic transformation. Say "Presto-Change-O, you're a pet store" — or a florist, or a law firm, or a space station — and the entire UI transforms instantly. Not just colors, but everything: the theme, the tabs, the persona, the AI's personality, even the metrics and KPIs adapt to that industry.

It should feel like the app was always built for that industry. No hints of "banking mode" leftover when you're in "pizza shop mode."

Works the same whether triggered via voice mode or text mode — the transformation is seamless either way.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Speed** — The transformation should feel immediate, no waiting around
- **Authenticity** — Should feel like a real app purpose-built for that industry
- **Completeness** — Everything changes coherently, nothing left behind from previous mode
- **Data consistency** — Generated data must be mathematically coherent (individual claims sum to total claims, percentages add to 100%, etc.)

The magic is the combination of all four. Can't compromise on any.

## Specific Ideas

- Use available AI models to generate CSS, images, HTML, JavaScript, and fake data on the fly
- Should handle any industry someone asks for — wild variety (pet store, law firm, space station) or conventional business (retail, services)
- Cross-modal: "Presto-Change-O" trigger works identically from voice or text
- All generated numbers must be internally consistent — if there are three claims of $50, $100, $150, the total must show $300

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This is the "wow factor" phase — the transformation should feel magical. The existing pre-built modes (Banking, Insurance, Healthcare) prove the concept; dynamic generation makes it work for literally anything.

No specific demo industries in mind — the point is it should just handle whatever comes at it.
